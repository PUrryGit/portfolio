    <p class="about-desc">
        I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for learning new technologies and programming languages.
        I believe there is something very fun about learning the intracicies of a new language, how it relates to languages I have experience with, and putting the pieces together in new ways.
        I have experience in building end-to-end features for private websites, mainly focused on the pipeline of data collection, integrating that data into a dashboard, and generating reports on that data.
        This includes making RESTful APIs and building SQL queries for customized reports that meet client needs.

                    Command.io is a Discord bot that allows the user to play local music files to a server over voice chat.
                    It has simple playlist functionality, such as queueing up songs and playing random songs amongst the queue.

                <div class="w3-padding-16">
                    This Discord bot came out of a need for sharing thematic music during sessions of Dungeons & Dragons.
                    After YouTube and Spotify removed their free legacy APIs, many music playing bots were taken offline.
                    This led me to learning DiscordJS and creating a bot that played local files, so I wouldn't have to rely on file API access.
                    The bot was originally created in DiscordJS v13, and upgraded to DiscordJS v14 when the API v13 used was sunset.
                    For a full list of features, you can find the project on the GitHub page.

                    Examples of some features, as shown in the image on the left:
                    <p><b>/roll</b> - Command.io has the ability to simulate dice rolling for custom-sized dice. For those particular cases where you may need a 1d2, or perhaps even a 7d7. Limits at d1000 for message overflow.</p>
                    <p><b>/rd20, /rd12, /rd10 etc.</b> - The bot comes pre-bundled with a number of /roll commands for popular dice sizes.</p>
                    <p><b>/play</b> - When given a filepath to a music file, Command.io will load the file into an AudioPlayer to play over a Discord channel. When used while another song is played, it will queue the songs into a playlist.</p>
                    <p><b>/next</b> - Moves the needle to the next file in the playlist.</p>
